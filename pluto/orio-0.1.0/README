INSTALLATION

The Orio installation follows the standard Python Module Distribution
Utilities, or Disutils for short.

For users who want to quickly install Orio to the standard locations
of third-party Python modules (requiring superuser privileges in a
Unix system), the installation is straightforward as shown below.

  % tar -xvzf orio.tar.gz
  % cd orio
  % python setup.py install

On a Unix platform, the above install command will normally put an
orcc script in the /usr/bin location, and also create an orio module
directory in the /usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages location.

To test whether Orio has been properly installed in your system, try
to execute orcc command as given below as an example.

  % orcc --help

  description: compile shell for Orio

  usage: orcc [options] <ifile> 
    <ifile>   input file containing the annotated code

  options:
    -h, --help                     display this message
    -o <file>, --output=<file>     place the output to <file>
    -v, --verbose                  verbosely show details of the results of the running program

In order to install Orio to an alternate location, users need to
supply a base directory for the installation. For instance, the
following command will install an orcc script under
/home/username/bin, and also put an orio module under
/home/username/lib/python/site-packages.

  % tar -xvzf orio.tar.gz
  % cd orio
  % python setup.py install --prefix=/home/username

It is also important to ensure that the installed Orio module location
is included in the PYTHONPATH environment variable. Similarly, users
can optionally include the installed orcc script location in the PATH
shell variable. To do this for the above example, the following two
lines can be added in the .bashrc configuration file (assuming the
user uses Bash shell, of course).

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/username/lib/python/site-packages
export PATH=$PATH:/home/username/bin
