# The problem here is to impose a scanning order for the polyhedron of the     #
# first example : the points are ordered by i+j values (a well known skewing). #

# 7. Seventh, we define the scanning order. In CLooG speaking, we talk about
#    scattering functions (a shortcut for scheduling, allocation etc.). It may
#    be useful to read the CLooG documentation about this point since it is
#    not trivial if you are not comfortable with transformations in the polytope
#    model. We describe them in three parts:
#    7.1 The number of scattering functions. It must be either 0 (in this case
#        there is no particular scanning order and CLooG will do what it wants)
#        or the number of polyhedra (set in part 4.).
#    7.2 The list of scattering functions. Each scattering function is a
#        constraint matrix (as those that describe context or polyhedra) but
#        made exclusively of equalities. They equate each new scattering
#        dimension with an affine expression of the original polyhedron
#        dimensions, the parameters and the scalar. CLooG will only respect the
#        ordering given by the scattering dimensions. If there are several 
#        scattering dimensions, CLooG will use the lexicographic ordering (the
#        first dimension leads, then the second one and so on). Every scattering
#        functions must have the same number of scattering dimensions.
#        Here we have c1=i+j, a one-dimensional scattering. It means that the
#        points of the original polyhedron with the same i+j value will be
#        scanned during the same iteration of the outer loop.
#    7.3 We set the scattering dimension names. We just put 0 if we want to let
#        CLooG decide names, 1 otherwise. If we put 1, at the next line we give
#        the space-separated parameter list.
1   # One scattering function (since there is only one polyhedron)
1 6 # The scattering function is a matrix of one row and six columns
# c1   i   j   n   1
0  1  -1  -1   0   0 # c1 = i+j
0   # We let CLooG choose the scattering dimension names
