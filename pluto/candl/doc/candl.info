1 Introduction
**************

There is a Doxygen documentation of the API available in
'doc/htmldoc.tar.gz'.

1.1 Installation of CAnDL
=========================

The installation of CAnDL follows the classical scheme.  You can specify
the path of PIPLib to the configure script with '--with-piplib' (1).

     $> tar xzf candl-0.2.0.tar.gz
     $> cd candl-0.2.0
     $> ./configure --prefix=/path/to/be/installed
     $> make


   The 'make check' command can be used to make a test run of CAnDL.

     $> make check


   The 'make install' command can be used to install the library.

     $> make install

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The configure script will automatically detect the location of
dependencies if _-prefix=path/to/dir_ is specified and all dependencies
were installed in path/to/dir
