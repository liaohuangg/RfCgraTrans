still to do before
0.14.0 - dumping functions
       - backtrack only to remove ifs
       - update documentation
       - configure for GMP and Solaris

0.14.1 - remove the constraint that all scattering functions must have the same
         dimensionality and use the new liberty degrees to generate better codes
         (e.g. continue loop fusion only when the stride is the same...)
       - if-hoisting instead of backtracking by option
       
0.14.2 clean loop during generation (haircut and never_integral)

0.14.3 allow non-integral scattering (easy: see PACT paper)

1.0.0  Omega-like input.
