thank you very much for the last information. I built already cloog static libraries and cloog, but I have still some troubles to make the shared library of cloog-0.12.2. I can work with the static version, but it may be also interesting to have a shared library too.

I am using the polylib-library 5.20.0 (64 bit) and gcc version 2.95.3 (20010315). The error message is:

             /*-----------------------------------------------*

Deleting the option -fPIC solve the problem with the second error message "option -f ..."

Did you have any idea how to solve the problem ? I just called configure --with-polylib=... and then make. Polylib libraries (shared and static) are build successfully (all tests ran properly)

Thank you in advance.
