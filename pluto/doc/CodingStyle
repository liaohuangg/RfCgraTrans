- Make sure your code is indented the same way as surrounding code

- Use spaces instead of tabs for indenting (for vim, set expandtab). All of
  Pluto uses a 4-space indent, try using the same. For vim, it should
  be  "set ts=4 sw=4 expandtab"

- For for/while loops, place the opening brace on the same line.

    for (i=0; i<N; i++) {


    }
  
- For function definitions, place opening brace on the next line:

void foo(void) 
{

}

- For if/else that have their blocks on a separate line, use braces (even if the
  block is a single line).

    if (...) {
        code;
    }else{
        code;
    }

  No need of braces if the then/else block appears on the same line

    if (...) code;
    else more code;

- Leave spaces in assignments for better readability. For eg.,  
  'sol[j] = cst->val[i][j];' instead of 'sol[j]=cst->val[i][j]'

- Leave space between arguments

  foo(a, b, c); 
  printf("%s\n", s);

  instead of

  foo(a,b,c);
  printf("%s\n",s);

- Any new functions added should at least have comments on what they do
