- compilation error with ISL :
  To test it, in isl-wrapper change #ifdef CANDL_SUPPORTS_ISL to
  #ifndef CANDL_SUPPORTS_ISL
  
  The error is :
  source/isl-wrapper.c: In function ‘isl_constraint_read_from_matrix’:
  source/isl-wrapper.c:79: warning: passing argument 1 of ‘isl_equality_alloc’ from incompatible pointer type
  /home/jpoudroux/usr/include/isl/constraint.h:28: note: expected ‘struct isl_local_space *’ but argument is of type ‘struct isl_space *’

- prunnning not finish (prunning.c: line 258 to 328)
  Uncomment the CANDL_COMPILE_PRUNNING in candl.h, or remove the ifdef in
  prunning.c

- change the type of the dependence/violation domain
  (at the end of candl_dependence_build_system and candl_matrix_violation)
  today it's : OSL_UNDEFINED
  
- candl_usr_init
  the statements must be sorted to compute the statement label
  the problem is if the scop is reordered, the second transformed scop
  must be "aligned" with it (the first statement need to corresponds to the first
  statement of the second scop, but the scattering could be different)

  Functions of clay, which could return a non ordered scop :
  (they create new statements)
  iss, unroll, peel
